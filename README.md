# responsive-restaurant-menu
This project is a solution for an assignment from the Coursera course HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Developers. The solution consists in an implementation of a responsive menu for a restaurant in a single page.

# Graded features
1. Create an 'index.html' file inside the solution container folder;
2. Provide 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with dropdown menu;
3. Must include a CSS file in a 'css' folder;
4. Use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework;
5. Define the desktop, tablet and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS classes ('md', 'sm' and 'xs');
6. Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page. The navbar should have a company name 'Food, LLC' that is aligned to the left of the navbar;
7. For desktop and tablet views, the navbar shouldn't contain anything else;
8. Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars), when the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear and show 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi. The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window and have a background color that distinguishes it from the rest of the content;
9. The heading thats say 'Our Menu' should be centered within the browser window
10. Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
